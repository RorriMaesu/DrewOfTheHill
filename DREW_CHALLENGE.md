# DREW OF THE HILL CHALLENGE
## The Ultimate Battle for Interdimensional Dominance

Fellow Andrews (and Andrew variants) of the multiverse,

**Are you the One True Drew?** Only one way to find out...

In a universe of infinite Andrews, a single question echoes through the cosmos: **WHO WILL REIGN SUPREME?** The Council of Andrew has created the ultimate competitive challenge to determine which variant deserves to be called the One True Drew.

## üèÜ THE CHALLENGE IS SIMPLE

Claim the hill and defend your title as long as possible. Every second you hold the hill adds to your total dominance score. The longer your reign, the higher you climb in the interdimensional rankings.

## üëë CURRENT LEADERBOARD STANDINGS

As of April 6, 2025, several Andrew variants have already staked their claim:

* **Drew C-137** - Currently dominating with a record-breaking 47-minute reign
* **Andy Quantum** - Accumulated the highest total time across multiple reigns
* **Andrew X-99** - Known for strategic hill claims during off-peak hours

**Will your designation appear at the top?** Or will you fade into obscurity like countless other Andrews across the multiverse?

## üî• WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN THE BATTLE

1. **REAL-TIME COMPETITION**: Watch as other Andrews try to dethrone you in real-time. Feel the adrenaline as your reign timer keeps climbing.

2. **BRAGGING RIGHTS**: Screenshot your name at the top of the leaderboard and secure ultimate bragging rights in any conversation.

3. **STRATEGIC DEPTH**: When is the best time to claim? How long can you defend? Develop your strategy to maximize your standings.

4. **INTERDIMENSIONAL GLORY**: Your achievements are recorded permanently in the Council of Andrew's secure database.
