## ðŸŒ€ About Drew of the Hill

Drew of the Hill is an interdimensional competitive game where Andrews across the multiverse battle to reign as the "One True Drew." Inspired by the Council of Ricks (but for Andrews), this game tracks which player has claimed "The Hill" and how long they've maintained their reign of dimensional dominance.

The core concept is simple but addictively competitive:
1. Register your Andrew designation (e.g., "Drew C-137")
2. Claim The Hill by clicking the button
3. Your reign timer starts counting up immediately
4. Other Andrews can dethrone you by claiming The Hill
5. Every second counts toward your total time and possibly your longest reign

Your time is recorded on two leaderboards:
- **Total Time** - The cumulative time you've spent as the One True Drew
- **Longest Reign** - Your single longest uninterrupted period of dimensional dominance

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-time Competitive Gameplay**: Instantly see when someone claims The Hill, with live-updating timers
- **Dual Leaderboards**: Compete on both total time and longest single reign
- **Interdimensional Portal Design**: Rick and Morty-inspired UI with portal effects and animations
- **Persistent Stats**: Your achievements are recorded permanently in the Firebase Realtime Database
- **Multiverse Identity**: Register your unique variant designation to be recognized across dimensions

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. Visit [Drew of the Hill](https://rorrimaesu.github.io/DrewOfTheHill/) in your browser
2. Enter your Andrew designation (your variant name in the multiverse)
3. Click the glowing "Become the One True Drew!" button to claim The Hill
4. Watch your reign timer count up in real-time
5. Come back regularly to reclaim The Hill when another Drew dethrones you
6. Check the leaderboards to see where you rank in the multiverse
